			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<p>Our story begins with a passion for cars and a desire to provide exceptional service to our community.

			<p>Starting in the Fall of 2022, we opened NexTier Detail with a commitment to quality, professionalism, and customer satisfaction. Since then, we have built a loyal customer base and have expanded our services to include everything from interior and exterior detailing to paint correction and ceramic coatings.</p>
